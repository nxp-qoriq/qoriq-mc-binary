## [10.24.0] - 2020-08-28
### Added
- **DPNI**
	* Added new create option `DPNI_OPT_SHARED_FS` to use a single shared table for flow steering rather than one table for each traffic class.
	When this option is set the HW resources utilization is optimized and this allows creation of more **DPNI** objects.
	Also when this option is enabled TC_ID should be set to 0 in dpni_add_fs_entry().
	* Added new command `dpni_dump_table` which allows users to dump the following types of tables: **VLAN, FS, MAC, QoS**.
	* Added new option `DPNI_BUF_LAYOUT_OPT_NO_SG` to `dpni_set_buffer_layout` **API** to allow Scatter Gather enable/disable for RX buffers
- **DPDMUX**
	* Added new commands: `dpdmux_if_set_taildrop`, `dpdmux_if_get_taildrop` to allow configuration and query of taildrop per **DPDMUX** interface
	* Added support for no buffer discard counter – can be set through `dpdmux_if_set_counter` and queried through `dpdmux_if_get_counter`

### Fixed
- **DPSW**
	* Fixed ACL table bug that discarded frames with MAC address not present in FDB. Now addresses not present in FDB are distributed correctly using ACL.

## [10.9.3] - 2018-08-06 
### Added
This release adds support for **USXGMII** on **LX2** platforms. Current supported speed is 10G.
Serdes lane reset on **LX2** is now performed if the following two conditions are met: CDR not locked or PCS
reports link down.

#### [API](https://source.codeaurora.org/external/qoriq/qoriq-components/mc-utils/tree/api/mc_release_10.9.3?h=mc_release_10.18.0 "API")


## [10.9.2] - 2018-07-13
### Changed
Update the initialization of available **WRIOP** resources when link speed is 100Gb on **LX2160** platform.

#### [API](https://source.codeaurora.org/external/qoriq/qoriq-components/mc-utils/tree/api/mc_release_10.9.2?h=mc_release_10.18.0 "API")


## [10.9.1] - 2018-07-05 
### Changed
- The CDR (Clock and Data Recovery) in Serdes block is occasionally not getting locked and to force the lock
a reset of the Serdes lanes is required.
The reset is performed during MC boot time as well as every second only for the lanes associated with the
**DPMACs** declared in **DPL** and defined as **TYPE_FIXED** in **DPC**.
The reset decision is taken upon CDR lock: if the lock is taken then no reset is performed, if not taken then
a reset is performed.
Along with Serdes lane reset a protocol reset is also performed for 25G, 40G, 50G and 100G ports on
**LX2160** platform.
- Lane reset is performed for **LS1088** and **LX2160** platforms.

## [10.9.0] - 2018-06-27  
### Added
- Support in **DPNI** create for separate number of RX and TX TCs

### Fixed
- **LX2:**
	* Fix for MC UART
	* Fixed PSS registers to reflect proper rate for 50G and 100G ports
	* When Serdes enables ports with the same ID as the **RGMII** ports, the Serdes ports
prevail over **RGMII** ports (on LX2, some Serdes combinations enable SGMIIs 17 and
18 which overlap RGMIIs)
- **DPSW**: Set per port default tail-drop values – fixes an occasional ~12% line rate drop due to
clock skew between LS boards and the testing equipment
- Fixed an issue which was causing TX confirmations to be delivered to wrong cores on LX2
and 40G MAC.2 was impacting the **RGMII** ports

## [10.6.0] - 2018-01-28 
### Added
This release adds support for Link Aggregation feature for L2Switch.
LAG configuration is available via API (`dpsw_lag_set`, `dpsw_lag_get_cfg`) and DPL.
Validated LAG features and known limitations:
- Single LAG group tested; up to 8 groups will be supported, validation is ongoing
- Group of 2 ports and 4 ports validated; up to 8 ports in a single group will be supported,
validation is ongoing
- Unicast frames transmitted and received from/into the LAG group; multicast support is ongoing
- Performance validation is ongoing
- The ports that can be added in a LAG group must be in the same Qman CEETM instance
	* CEETM instance 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12}
	* CEETM instance 2: {5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16}
	* Dynamic reallocation of ports will be implemented to allow users to add any port to the same LAG group
	
**API** configuration example:

	```
	dpsw_lag_cfg.group_id = 1;
	dpsw_lag_cfg.num_ifs = 2;
	dpsw_lag_cfg.if_id[0] = 0; // DPSW interface 0
	dpsw_lag_cfg.if_id[1] = 1; // DPSW interface 1
	err = dpsw_lag_set(&dpsw->io, 0, dpsw->token, &dpsw_lag_cfg);
	```
**DPL** configuration example:

	```
	dpsw@1{
			….
			lag1 = <0 1>; // this will create LAG group 1 with DPSW interfaces 0 and 1
						  //added to the group
		  };
	```
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that was limiting bandwidth through **DPDMUX** to 1G
- LX2 emulation (PXP/CFP): removed polling of unimplemented bit on cEMAC ports during RX
  graceful stop procedure – this was causing the **WRIOP** ports to remain disabled
